Standard Merge:
A standard merge creates a new commit that combines changes from both branches. 
It preserves the complete history, showing when and where branches diverged and merged. 
This method is useful when maintaining a clear history of all merges is important and when multiple team members contribute to different parts of the codebase.

Squash Merge:
Squash merge combines all commits from the feature branch into a single commit before merging it into the main branch. 
This simplifies the history by reducing multiple commits into one. 
It's ideal for keeping the main branch clean and concise, especially for small or experimental changes that donâ€™t need detailed commit history.

Rebase Merge:
Rebasing rewrites the commit history by applying the changes from the feature branch directly on top of the main branch. 
It makes the history linear and easier to follow. Rebase is suitable when you want a clean history without merge commits, but it can be dangerous in shared branches due to its rewriting of commit history.
